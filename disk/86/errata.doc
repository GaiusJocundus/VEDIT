		--------------------------------


There are several typos in the manual which you should correct.  Several
last minute enhancements to the program are also not reflected in the manual.
We apologize for the inconvenience.

To print this file, give the DOS command:

	VPLUS -X PRINT.EXC ERRATA.DOC


Note that the on-line help file VPHELP.HLP is completely up to date.



ERRATA
------

Pg 45		Second and third sentences of last paragraph should read:

		"All markers are initially reset.  Jumping to a reset marker 
		has no effect.  If text containing a marker is written to 
		disk, that marker is reset."		

Pg 86		Second to last paragraph.  The references to "YL" and "YK"
		are reversed.

Pg 89		Second prompt should read "Enter Edit Buffer Name:".

Pg 91		First and third prompts should read "Enter Edit Buffer Name:".

Pg 94		Description for "[D]elete" should read:

		"Prompts for the name of the window to be deleted.  Switches 
		to the main "@" edit buffer and window.  Only the "@" window 
		cannot be deleted.  Exiting or quitting an edit buffer does 
		NOT delete its corresponding window."
		
Pg 94, 95	The prompts "Enter Window Name" and "Top Bottom Left Right"
		and their corresponding descriptions are reversed.

Pg 106		Step 2. should read "0L 1RC9 L RG9 -L".

Pg 133		Note that the function [WINDOW]-Switch can be used to switch
		between edit buffers even if you haven't split your screen
		into "windows".

Pg 150		Delete the last sentence on the page beginning with
		"Additionally ...".  See "Enhancements" below.

Pg 158		The example near the bottom of the page should read "EP 4 2".

Pg 261		The "OC" command follows the rules of explicit delimiters. 
		An alternative to the example is: "@OC/VPRINT CHAPTER1/". 
		The "|Rr" construct may be used to access the DOS command 
		stored in register 'r'.

Pg 288		The "Notes" can be ignored.  Windows can be deleted in a 
		random order.  See the "YWD" command enhancement below.  

Pg 289		The examples should read "YWR1 40" and "YWB$ 5".  In other
		words, there must be no space before the window name.

Pg 311		Delete the last sentence for Task 7.2.  (This parameter
		can now be changed without having to perform the keyboard
		layout again.)

Pg 329		The "Expert" keyboard layout supplied in the file EXPERT.COM
		(see below) includes three additional keystroke macros:

		[GOTO]-Home	<ALT-H>
		[GOTO]-Zend	<ALT-Z>
		[PRINT]-Block	<CTRL-P>

Pg 331		The pre-installed value for "DELAY FOR COMMAND MODE
		SCROLLING" is 00.  You can change it to 50 if the
		screen scrolls too fast for you in Command Mode.

Pg 346		In [FIND] description.  Should read "... up to 80 
		characters ...".

Pg 359		"YEE" is incorrect; it should be "YEL".

		The "YWI" command was left out.  "YWI" initializes
		the screen back to a single window.

		The "YWS" command was left out.  "YWSw" switches to
		window 'w'.  "YWS" switches to window "@".



FILES
-----

EXPERT.COM	This is a runnable VEDIT PLUS preconfigured to the "Expert"
		keyboard layout.  See page 328.  Unless you have a very
		strong inclination to have the "menu-functions" assigned to
		the function keys, we highly recommend the "Expert" layout.

KEYS.IBM	This is a graphic representation of the pre-configured 
		keyboard layout for the IBM PC.  It is three screens long and
		may be used to replace the first two screens of the on-line
		help file VVHELP.HLP.

CV203.VDM	This is a macro which converts version 2.02 macros into
		2.03 macros.

STRIPV.VDM	This macro strips comments from VEDIT PLUS macros.  Primarily
		for CP/M (8080 / Z80) machines, where it is important to save
		memory space.



ENHANCEMENTS
------------

EM command	You can use the command form "nEM" to indicate that the 
		command is to be performed 'n' times.

EP, ES, ET	(See Page 150.)  VEDIT PLUS maintains a separate set
  commands	of "EP", "ES" and "ET" values for each edit buffer.
		Changing these values will only affect the current and
		subsequently created edit buffers.  Alternatively, you
		can use the command forms "-EP n k", "-ES n k" and 
		"ET n1 n2 ..." to change only the values for the current
		edit buffer.

ER command	The command "+ER<ESC>" displays the current input filename 
		and includes its drive and/or path.  ("ER<ESC>" only displays 
		the filename.)

EW command	The command "+EW<ESC>" displays the current output filename 
		and includes its drive and/or path.

OD		Displays the system date.  ":OD" suppresses the final <CR>
		<LF>.  Use the command "YI OD -YI" to insert the date into
		your text.

OT		Displays the system time.  ":OD" suppresses the final <CR>
		<LF>.

PE command	The command "-PE" resets the internal line counter for 
		printing without ejecting a page on the printer.  Primarily
		useful in printing macros which change the "PP" parameters.

XT command	The command form "-XTr" will left justify the number.
		("XTr" right justifies the number.)

YL command	The command form "+YL file" performs an extended search for
		the keyboard layout file 'file'.

YWD command	The command "YWDw" deletes window 'w'.
		("YWD" deletes the current window.)

V command	The command "-V" performs an update-only of the visual mode 
		window.  Its only real use is inside macros which need to
		update a window.  (Otherwise any visual mode windows only
		update while waiting for keyboard input from Command mode.)

.lm value	The internal value ".lm" is the current left margin, i,e.
		the indent position in Visual Mode.

.rtR value	The internal value ".rtR" returns the "type" for register 'R':
		0 = unused, 1 = text register, 2 = edit buffer.

.wd value	The internal value ".wd" is the current display type:
		0 = CRT terminal,   1 = Non-IBM memory mapped
		2 = IBM Monochrome, 3 = IBM Color (CGA or EGA)

.wx value	The internal value ".wx" contains the horizontal ("x")
		position of the cursor in the window.

.wy value	The internal value ".wy" contains the vertical ("y")
		position of the cursor in the window.



[CANCEL] and <CTRL-C>
---------------------

On the IBM PC, [CANCEL] can now be used as an alternative to <CTRL-C> to 
cancel edit functions which are prompting on the status line.  [CANCEL] can 
also be used in place of <CTRL-C> in Command Mode to abort macros, etc.



CAPS Lock / NUM Lock / Scroll Lock  (IBM PC Only)
----------------------------------

On the IBM PC, the status of the Caps/Num/Scroll Lock is now displayed on 
the status line with the single letters "C", "N" and "S".



Keystroke Macros
----------------

When the manual was written, keystroke macros could only be used in Visual 
Mode.  Now they can also be used in Command Mode.  For example, you could
use the [DEFINE] function to assign the command "ED *.ASM <RETURN>" to the key
<SHIFT-F1>.  Pressing <SHIFT-F1> in Command Mode would then execute the 
command.  There is one restriction: keystroke macros used in Command Mode 
cannot be accessed via multi-key "escape sequences".  This is a serious 
restriction for CRT terminals, but not for the IBM PC.

Visual Mode keystroke macros can be a combination of visual mode functions 
and Command Mode commands.  This allows virtually any edit function to be 
created.  Here are a few examples:

Example: Function to "open" a blank line above the current one.
	 (Similar to "open-line" in EMACS)

	 [VISUAL EXIT] 0L @I/<RETURN>/ -L

Example: Function to transpose two letters.

	 [VISUAL EXIT] .p,.p+1RCT D -C RGT

Example: Function to delete characters from the beginning of the line up
	 to the cursor.

	 [VISUAL EXIT] 0K


Be sure to use [VISUAL EXIT]; [VISUAL ESCAPE] will not work.

NOTE:	DO NOT END THE MACRO WITH A "V"; OTHERWISE ERRORS WILL OCCUR!
	The macro will automatically reenter Visual Mode.

Any desired keystroke macros can be built into VEDIT PLUS during 
Installation.  There is no absolute limit to how many keystroke macros can be 
built in or added with [DEFINE].  Of course, keystroke macros take up memory 
space.  INSTALL limits the length of EACH keystroke macro to 200 characters.  
The "VPLUS.COM" file will grow in size as keystroke macros are added.

Both status line prompts for the [DEFINE] function can be aborted by pressing
[BACKSPACE].  This implies that [BACKSPACE] cannot be part of a keystroke
macro.  However, you can perform the equivalent function with [CURSOR LEFT]
and [DELETE].  Alternatively, [BACKSPACE] may be built in during Installation.



GRAPHICS CHARACTERS  (IBM PC Only)
-------------------

The IBM PC <ALT>-keypad feature can be used to directly enter graphics 
characters into the text.  Contrary to the description on page 75, it is NOT 
necessary to precede the character with [NEXT CHAR LITERAL].

You can easily create the following box top with a 50 character width.

Example:   浜様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様融

First type "<ALT>-201" (hold down the <ALT> key and type 201 on the keypad).
Then press [REPEAT], type "48" and "<ALT>-205".  Last type "<ALT>-187".



CURSOR TYPE / COLOR  (IBM PC Only)
-------------------

You can select from four different cursor types are described on page 306. 
For types 1, 2, and 3 the cursor's color is normally set to the background 
color.  If desired, you can override this during Installation with Task 
11.5.  This value is normally set to 0.  Any other value sets the override 
attribute for the cursor.  For example, a value of "C0" gives a red cursor 
regardless of the color of the text characters.  (This is not documented in 
the manual.)

If you choose a highlighted color such as yellow (attribute 14 decimal) for 
your text, you may not like the resulting cursor color.  In this case you can 
set Installation Task 11.5 to the desired cursor color.



DEMO
----

For a quick demonstration of some of VEDIT PLUS's windowing and macro
capabilities, locate two of your files which are similar, but contain a few
differences.  Then compare them using the supplied COMPARE macro.  Just
give the command:

VPLUS -X COMPARE.VDM

The macro prompts for the information it needs.  See Pages 112-113 in the
manual for more information on using this macro.  

One COMPARE feature not described in the manual is that you can use the 
[WINDOW]-Switch operation to quickly switch between the "active" and the 
"template" files.  Press [WINDOW]-Switch and "P" to switch to the template 
file; press [WINDOW]-Switch and RETURN to switch back to the active file.



SMALL MEMORY MODE  (8086 Only)
-----------------

For optimum performance VEDIT PLUS will use a lot, or even all, of memory.  
In particular, it will try to reserve one 64K memory segment for the text 
registers, another 64K for the main edit buffer, and additional 64K segments 
for each edit buffer, until all memory is used up.  The program itself takes 
another 35K.  Normally this works best.  However, if you try to run other 
programs from within VEDIT PLUS (via the "OC" and "OS" commands), you may 
find that you don't have enough memory left.  If this happens you should 
first "quit" any unused edit buffers.  If this is not enough, you can run 
VEDIT PLUS in its "small memory mode", in which it only uses 64K of memory 
for all edit buffers and text registers.  (Total memory usage = 99K).  You 
may also want to run in "small memory mode" with multi-tasking programs such 
as TopView, Microsoft Windows or DESQView.  To run in "small memory mode", 
invoke VEDIT PLUS as follows:

	VPLUS -S filename



ERROR HANDLING  (MS-DOS Only)
--------------

VEDIT PLUS handles all disk errors, including having a disk drive door open, 
read and write errors.  It also handles printer errors.  When an error 
occurs, the status line displays a descriptive message and prompts with:

CANCEL, IGNORE, RETRY (C/I/R)?

Type "C" to cancel the operation.  This is safe because it returns to VEDIT 
PLUS.  Type "R" to re-try the operation, such as after closing the drive 
door.  You can type "I" to ignore, but this usually just leads to another 
error.



PRESERVING YOUR FILES
---------------------

VEDIT PLUS is designed to make it as unlikely as possible for you to 
accidentally lose a file or your edited text.  However, nothing is foolproof.  
The best safeguard is to save your edited file to disk at least once an hour 
(using [FILE]-Save or the "EA" command) and backing up your work at the end 
of each day.  

You should use the following commands with additional care:

1.  The "EK" command erases files similar to the DOS "ERASE" command.  
    Fortunately, the "EK" is actually safer to use since it displays the 
    filenames about to be erased and requests confirmation.

2.  The "EQ" and "EZ" commands and the [FILE]-Quit operation abandon the edit 
    changes you have just made.  They are very useful, but you don't want to 
    use them when you really wanted to save your changes.  These commands 
    request confirmation before throwing your text away.  Also, they do not 
    change or erase the original files on disk.

3.  The "EF" command is primarily intended for splitting large files into 
    smaller ones.  "EF" is almost always preceded by a "W" command.  Don't 
    use "EF" to quit or save your editing.  This command requests confirmation.

4.  The "OS" command lets you enter DOS for as long as you wish.  However, it
    does not save the files you are editing to disk.  Therefore, be sure to 
    return to VEDIT PLUS (with the DOS command "EXIT") to save your files.
    It is easy to forget that you are still in VEDIT PLUS and turn the
    computer off - losing your edit changes.  As a safeguard, you may wish
    to save your files (use "EY" or "EA" commands) before entering DOS.

As an additional safeguard, VEDIT PLUS always creates a "backup" when you 
revise an existing file.  The backup has a filename extension of ".BAK" and 
is created whenever you save the newest revisions to disk.  Therefore, if you 
accidentally erase an important file (either with VEDIT PLUS or DOS) you will 
still have the backup (unless you explicitly erased it).  To use the backup, 
just rename it to the desired filename; you cannot directly edit a ".BAK" 
file.
