MEMORY MAPPED VERSUS CRT VERSION

The file VPLUS.CMD contains the memory mapped version of VEDIT PLUS.  
It provides very high speed screen updating and is the preferred 
version to use.  However, it does not support Concurrent's "windows".  
If you are using Concurrent's "windows" you must use the CRT terminal 
version of VEDIT PLUS in the file VPLUS86C.SET.  The disadvantage of 
the CRT version is that it does not update the screen nearly as fast.


THE PROGRAMMED FUNCTION KEYS WITH CONCURRENT CP/M-86

Concurrent CP/M-86 on the IBM PC normally has the function keys 
expanded to emit 'strings' such as "DIR A:".  (See CCP/M-86 FUNCTION 
command.)  Such key expansion is not usable with VEDIT PLUS.  Therefore, 
VEDIT PLUS must be setup to reprogram the function keys.  With 
Concurrent CP/M-86 versions 3.0 and later, this is easy; sending the 
escape sequence "ESC 6" disables the key expansion and lets VEDIT PLUS 
use the function keys.  However, with earlier versions of Concurrent 
CP/M-86, all of the function keys must be reprogrammed.  The CRT version 
automatically disables key expansion during editing when you pick "IBM 
PC (CONC. CP/M-86)" as the terminal type during Installation.

For the memory mapped version, you can have VEDIT PLUS reprogram the 
function keys (or disable key expansion) using its autostartup feature.  
To use the autostartup feature rename the supplied file VEDITCC.INI to 
VEDIT.INI and copy it to User 0 of your hard disk (or system disk). 
With early versions of Concurrent CP/M-86 you must also copy the 
supplied file IBMSETUP to User 0 of your hard disk.  With Concurrent 
version 3.0 or later you must copy the supplied file ESC6 to User 0 on 
the hard disk and rename it to IBMSETUP.


INSTALLATION NOTES:

Before performing the Installation you must reprogram the function keys 
(or disable key expansion) by giving the command:

	TYPE IBMSETUP

The commands to install the Memory Mapped and CRT versions of VEDIT 
PLUS are respectively:

	INSTALL VPLUS.CMD

	INSTALL VPLUS86C.SET VPLUS.CMD

For the CRT version Installation you must run Task 12 and select
"IBM PC (CONC. CP/M-86)" as the terminal type.


We have found so much variation between different versions of 
Concurrent CP/M-86 that it is impossible to predict which keyboard 
layouts will work.  Early versions did not support things like 
"<ALT>-F1", while later releases do.  Therefore, early versions will 
require setting up the keyboard as on page 330 of the manual.  Later 
versions can use the normal keyboard layout or "Expert" keyboard 
layout.  However, even the later versions have differences.  Therefore, 
if the preconfigured VPLUS.CMD does not respond properly to the 
keyboard, you should try performing Task 2 of the Installation.


DETAILS OF AUTOSTARTUP

When VEDIT is invoked to edit a file on disk, it can search the default 
drive and a specified drive for a file called 'VEDIT.INI'.  The details 
of this search are controlled by Task 9 of the Installation.  VEDIT 
treats the contents of VEDIT.INI as command mode instructions and 
executes before you begin editing.

It is important to remember that VEDIT will not give an error message 
if there is no VEDIT.INI file on the disk and consequently will not 
program the keys for use with VEDIT.  

The file VEDITCC.INI contains the following commands: 


+RL1 IBMSETUP       VEDIT searches for  the  file  "IBMSETUP"  and,  if 
		    found,  copies  its contents into TEXT REGISTER "1".

YO RD1 -YO          The  contents  of  register  "1",  i.e.  the file 
		    IBMSETUP is sent to the operating system.   Control 
		    characters are not expanded.  Concurrent intercepts 
		    these characters  and  reprograms  the  keys.  (The 
		    undocumented  command YO reroutes console output to 
		    the operating system.)

RE1                 The text in register "1" is emptied.


After the auto-startup file has executed, VEDIT lets you begin editing.

Concurrent CP/M-86 allows the function keys to be re-programmed by 
typing out an appropriate file (in this case IBMSETUP).  Concurrent 
CP/M-86 programs the keys initially with its Startup feature, when it 
is booted, by invoking the program FUNCTION.  It is important to note 
that FUNCTION must have been run before the IBMSETUP file will work 
properly.  This is not normally a problem because FUNCTION is 
automatically run at startup.  However, if you disable the startup, the 
typing of IBMSETUP may "hang" the system.  Therefore, FUNCTION must be 
run sometime prior to typing IBMSETUP.
