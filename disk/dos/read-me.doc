
			WELCOME TO VEDIT PLUS 2.33
			--------------------------

	Before you get started, please read these notes.

1.  Print the file README.CRT.  It contains important notes on installing
    and using the CRT version of VEDIT PLUS.  It also contains the
    "Default" keyboard layout and example layouts for several terminals.

2.  You don't have to read the whole manual!  You generally only have to
    perform steps 1 and 2 of the Installation (pages 298 - 301) to get
    started.  If you have a hard disk you should also follow the instructions
    on page 18.  Then go directly to the short tutorial beginning on page 19.

3.  Be sure to read the "ERRATA.DOC" file.  It mainly covers enhancements
    made after the manual was printed.  You don't want to miss them!
