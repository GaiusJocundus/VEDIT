	Whenever a patch is made to any of the VEDIT .SET files with DDT
or another debugger, a checksum error will be introduced which will give
the error message: "WARNING - VEDIT CHECKSUM ERROR" during customization.
 The following procedure allows you to remove the checksum error from the
.SET file. If this message occurs with a .SET file which was not patched,
the file may be defective.


	This assumes that the particular .SET file is "VEDIT86.SET" and
that this file and VDSETCRT.CMD are on drive "B:".

1.)	Issue the command:

	B>VDSETCRT VEDIT86 NEW86	(followed by a RETURN)

	After the message "WARNING - VEDIT CHECKSUM ERROR" appears, type
	the RETURN key to ignore the error.

	Choose Task 8 (return to operating system) to immediately exit
	the customization program.  This will have created the file
	"NEW86.CMD" which does not contain a checksum error, and can now
	be renamed to the .SET file.

2.)	Issue the commands:

	B>ERA VEDIT86.SET<ret>		(This erases the old .SET file)

	B>REN VEDIT86.SET=NEW86.CMD     (This creates a new VEDIT86.SET)

	You now have a VEDIT86.SET without the checksum error!
