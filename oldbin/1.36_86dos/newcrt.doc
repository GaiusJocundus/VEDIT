	Please follow this procedure to modify the CRT tables used
in customizing VEDIT for different CRT terminals.  This procedure
allows you to make the changes necessary for VEDIT to support a
terminal which is not listed in the CRT terminal menu.


1. Select a CRT entry in the file CRT.ASM for modification. (Usually
   CUSTOMER 2 for new CRT terminals)

2. Edit the relevant crt table. Look at the comments at the begining of
   CRT.ASM for information about what each entry (line) in the crt table
   represents.

3. Assemble CRT.ASM

4. Load CRT.HEX

5. Erase CRT.TBL (this was the original crt table)

6. Issue the command:REN CRT.TBL=CRT.COM <return>

7. Now you may re-customize VEDIT and choose the number of the
   CRT terminal which corresponds to the crt entry which has been
   modified.



NOTES:	1. Note that you may only modify an existing crt table in
	   the file CRT.ASM, and that an error will occur if you
	   attempt to add another entry to the CRT.ASM file.
