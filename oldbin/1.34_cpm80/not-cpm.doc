     These notes describe several patches  which can be made to
the VEDIT programs  in order  to satisfy  special applications.
In particular, these notes describe two patches:

1.)  To allow  a  destinction  between  upper  and  lower  case
     letters in escape sequences.

2.)  To allow a change in the way console I/O is handled.  This
may be useful to  users not running CP/M  or MP/M,to users with
CRT emulation software instead  of a true  CRT terminal, and to
user running with an interrupt driven keyboard.


     -----------------------------------------------------

     During the keyboard  layout customization,  VEDIT is setup
to make no distinction between upper  and lower case letters in
escape sequences.  Therefore, "ESC H" will  be treated the same
as "ESC  h".  This is  to the  benefit of  users who  hand type
escape sequences for some  of the visual  functions, and do not
wish to be concerned over whether  the Alpha-Lock is enabled on
their keyboard.  However, some  users  may  wish  to have VEDIT
make a distinction  between  upper  and  lower  case letters in
escape sequences.  For example,  Televideo  910,  920C  and 950
users will probably want the  destinction, because the function
keys on the terminal  send  an  escape  sequence  with a letter
which is in upper or lower case depending upon the Shift Key.


     These notes are  only  applicable  to  users  who  are not
running CP/M or MP/M,  and  to  experienced  users  who wish to
change the way console  I/O is  handled in  the VEDIT programs.
The new VEDIT user running CP/M or MP/M therefore does not need
to read or understand these notes!

     The   VEDIT   programs   are    normally   configured   to
automatically determine whether they  are running in  a CP/M or
an MP/M  environment.  This is  accomplished by  performing the
system call "12".  Under  CP/M,  console  I/O  is done directly
through BIOS, while  in  MP/M,  the  system  call  "6" is used.
While this works well with  CP/M and MP/M it  may not work with
other "CP/M  compatible"  operating  systems.  Particularly, it
will not  work  with  Cromemco's  CDOS,  which  has  a  totally
different system call "12".  The CDOS  user will therefore need
to patch one byte  in each  of the  VEDIT programs  so that the
system  call  "12"  is  not  performed.  If  your  distribution
diskette is marked "CDOS",  this byte has  already been patched
to the correct  value.  This  byte  is  the  refered  to as the
"SETBYT" and is described below.

     VEDIT  performs frequent  polling  of  the  console status
routine in order to permit type-ahead and prevent loosing typed
characters.  The keyboard polling routine  inside VEDIT has two
entry points.  One is used for very frequent polling, where the
keyboard is  polled  once  for  every  character  send  to  the
terminal and  about  once  every  millisecond  while performing
internal operations.  The second  entry point is  used for much
less frequent polling, about once  every 50 milliseconds, which
is enough  to keep  up with  the fastest  typist, but  not fast
enough for single key generated escape sequences.  The "SETBYT"

also  determines  whether  the  fast  polling  entry  point  is
disabled and even  allows all  polling to  be disabled.  In the
normal distribution, the  CRT version  is setup  to do frequent
polling under CP/M  and the  less frequent  polling under MP/M.
All Memory Mapped  versions perform the  less frequent polling.
Since the frequent polling slows things  down a little, you may
wish to disable the fast polling in  the CRT version if you are
not using a terminal  which sends single  key escape sequences,
i.e. a Heath H19,  IBM 3101,  Televideo 920C,  etc.  If you are
running with an  interrupt  driven  keyboard,  you  may wish to
disable both the fast and slow polling.

     The  "SETBYT"   in   the   VEDIT   programs  (VEDITZC.SET,
VEDIT8M.SET, VEDSET.COM, VDSETCRT.COM)  is  always  at location
010A Hex. (430A Hex in ORG 4200 systems).  It has 6 significant
bits in the main  VEDIT programs and 2  significant bits in the
VEDSET and VDSETCRT programs.  The bits are defined below:

Bit 0     "1" means auto determination of CP/M or MP/M.
          "0" means CP/M or MP/M is determined by Bit 1.
Bit 1     Only significant when Bit 0 = "0".
          "1" means MP/M using System call 6 for console I/O.
          "0" means CP/M using direct BIOS calls.

Bit 2     Bits 2 and 3 are only significant for CP/M.
          "1" means disable all keyboard polling.
          "0" means enable at least normal keyboard polling.
Bit 3     "1" means disable frequent keyboard polling.
          "0" means enable frequent keyboard polling.

Bit 4     Bits 4 and 5 are only significant for MP/M.
          "1" means disable all keyboard polling.
          "0" means enable at least normal keyboard polling.
Bit 5     "1" means disable frequent keyboard polling.
          "0" means enable frequent keyboard polling.


     The normal distribution  version  of  the  CRT  version of
VEDIT has a "SETBYT" value of "00100001 Binary" (21 Hex) in the
".SET" files  to signify  auto determination  of CP/M  or MP/M,
fast polling for CP/M and  normal polling for MP/M.  Similarly,
the Memory Mapped version  of  VEDIT  has  a  "SETBYT" value of
"00101001 Binary" (29 Hex) in the  ".SET" files to signify auto
determination of CP/M  or  MP/M,  normal  polling  for CP/M and
normal polling for MP/M.  The normal distribution of VEDSET.COM
and VDSETCRT.COM have a "SETBYT"  value of "00000001 Binary" to
signify auto-determination of CP/M or MP/M.

     The  CDOS  user  will  need  to  change  the  "SETBYT"  to
"00100000 Binary" or  (20 Hex)  in the  appropriate ".SET" file
and to "00 Hex" in the VEDSET.COM or VDSETCRT.COM files.
