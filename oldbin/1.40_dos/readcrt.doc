     This file contains additional notes regarding the terminals
supported by the INSTALL program.

     Hazeltine terminal users should note  that  there  are  two
Hazeltine  entries in the menu of terminals.  One terminal entry
is for Hazeltine and Volker Craig terminals which  use  the  '~'
character  (code  7E  hex) as an escape leadin, and the other is
for terminals which use the "ESC" character as a leadin.

     On Hazeltine terminals you must set the  "Auto  LF"  option
switch to the OFF position.  This will not affect the terminal's
operation, but is necessary for VEDIT to work properly.

     Following your selection of a terminal from the  menu,  the
customization   program   asks   for  up  to  two  "Escape  Mode
Characters", in case you are using  escape  sequences  from  the
keyboard.  Your terminal may also send escape sequences when you
type a function key.  For example, the  Heath/Zenith  H19  sends
escape sequences beginning with the ESC character. The Televideo
920C sends escape sequences beginning with "CTRL-A".

     The next two questions are "Enter Common 2nd  Character  #1
in Escape Sequence" and "Enter Common 2nd Character #2 in Escape
Sequence".  Simply answer with a <RETURN> if you are  not  using
escape  sequences  or are typing them in by hand.  However, some
terminal's special function keys send 3 letter escape  sequences
where  the  second  letter  is  always  the  same  and should be
ignored.  In this case, answer with this second character.

     For example, on the H19 using Heath Mode, the PF1 key sends
an "ESC ? p", the PF2 key sends an "ESC ? r" and so on.  In this
case, the "?"  is  the  "Common  2nd  Character  #1...".  Answer
RETURN to "Common 2nd Character #2...".

     On  the  VT-100,  VT-180 and other ANSI standard terminals,
the function keys send sequences such as "ESC O A", "ESC  O  B",
"ESC [ H", "ESC [ I", etc, where both the "O" and "[" are common
2nd characters which are to be ignored.  Therefore  "Common  2nd
Character  #1..."  should be answered with a "O" (capital letter
O), and "Common 2nd Character #2..." should be answered  with  a
"[".

     Some  terminals,  like  the  IBM 3101, also send a Carriage
Return  at  the  end  of   escape   sequences.    The   keyboard
customization  detects  this  automatically  and you need not be
concerned with it.

     While most terminals  have  24  lines,  some  have  a  25th
"Status  Line".   On  some of these, it is possible for VEDIT to
place its status line on the 25th line.  To use  the  25th  line
answer the question "Enter Number of Screen Lines"  with a "25".
Note that  the Intertube must be specified as having  25  lines.
VEDIT  cannot  use the status lines on the TELEVIDEO or IBM 3101
terminals.

     In the CRT version of VEDIT, the right-most column  of  the
screen  is  not  used.   This  is  necessary  because  many  CRT
terminals perform a scroll when the last column  in  the  bottom
row  is  written.   If  loosing this last column is a problem to
you, and you are sure that your CRT does not scroll when writing
the  last  screen  position,  you  may  customize VEDIT with the
screen  length  value  one  larger   than   the   true   length.
Specifically,  the  H19  may  be  customized with a "81" for the
screen length parameter (customization Task 10.2).

     If  you have a terminal which is not mentioned in the menu,
you can add or modify a table entry  with  the  INTMOD  program.
See the file NEWCRT.DOC for further details on operation of this
program.

     While we  have  made  every  effort  to  support  each  CRT
terminal  correctly,  it  is not feasible for anyone to test all
models  of  every   manufacturer.    Should   you   notice   any
aberrations,  such  as scrambled lines or lost characters, it is
almost certainly due to an incorrect setting on your terminal or
an  error in the support for your terminal.  Please be sure that
any switches pertaining to cursor addressing, editing  functions
and  correct  "Escape Sequence Lead In" are enabled.  Should you
have any suggestions  or  difficulties,  no  matter  how  minor,
please contact us.  Should you write, please include your office
and home phone numbers.
