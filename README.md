# VEDIT / VEDIT-PLUS for CP/M

## Overview

This is the source code to VEDIT / VEDIT-PLUS for CP/M version 2.33b
(04/27/1987), the commercial text editing system and text-oriented
programming language, produced by Theodore Green and Greenview Data
Inc. (formerly CompuView Products, Inc.) of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

This incarnation of VEDIT was created in 1979 and was commercially
supported until 1988 (when it was superseded by VEDIT 3) and is the
direct predecessor of the current [vEdit](https://www.vedit.com/)
product available from VEDIT, Inc.

This VEDIT / VEDIT-PLUS source code can be assembled to produce
binaries compatible with various processors (8080, Z80, etc.) and
operating systems (CP/M, MP/M, CDOS, etc.).

Historically, compatible VEDIT / VEDIT-PLUS versions were adapted
for CP/M-80, MP/M-80, CDOS, CP/M-86, MP/M-86, Concurrent CP/M-86,
SCP 86-DOS, MS-DOS, Cromix, and Turbo DOS.  Later versions were
available for PC-MOS/386, CP/M-68K, IBM 4960/FlexOS, UNIX/Xenix,
QNX, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows (both 16-bit Windows 3.1 and
32-bit Windows 95/NT versions). Companion programs (V-PRINT,
V-SPELL, etc.) were also produced.

## Introduction

VEDIT is an editor designed to take full advantage of a CRT display to
make your word processing and program development editing as fast and
easy as possible.  VEDIT's Visual Mode offers true "What you see is what
you get" type editing, which continuously displays a region of your file
on the screen and allows any changes made to the screen display to become
the changes in the file.  You can change the screen display by moving the
displayed cursor to any place in the file and then typing in new text or
typing an edit function key.  These insertions, deletions, and corrections
are immediately seen on the screen and become the changes to the file.

You can also perform the common word processing operations of wrapping
words at the end of lines and formatting paragraphs between right and
left margins.  It is easy to print any portion of the text being worked
on. Horizontal scrolling allows editing of very long lines.  Ten
scratchpad buffers may be used for extensive "cut and paste" operations.
Powerful search and selective replace operations simplify editing.
Other features, such as automatic indenting for structured programming
languages, simplify and enhance program development editing.

VEDIT also provides a very flexible and powerful Command Mode, which
serves the dual purpose of separating the less commonly used functions
from the Visual Mode, and of making VEDIT a text oriented programming
language.  Repetitive editing operations can be performed and blocks of
text may be copied or moved within the current file and other files in
an almost unlimited manner.  The extensive file handling allows multiple
files to be edited, split, and merged, other files to be viewed, and
specified portions of other files to be extracted.  The command macro
capability allows complex editing tasks to be performed automatically.
Examples of such tasks include numerous search/replace operations on
multiple files and source code translations.  The command macros can be
saved on disk for future use.  On line help is available.

You can edit files of virtually any size with little concern over the
actual size of the files.  You can also recover from common disk write
errors, such as running out of disk space, by deleting files or inserting
another disk.

Since so many different hardware configurations, keyboards, editing
applications, and personal preferences exist, VEDIT is supplied with a
customization (installation) program in order to let users create
versions of VEDIT which are most suitable to their hardware, keyboard,
applications, and preferences.
