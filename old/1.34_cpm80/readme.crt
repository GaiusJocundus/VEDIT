     The menu of CRT terminals displayed in the customization
program contains two undefined entries: "Customer 2" and
"Customer 1".  These are actually preconfigured as alternates
for some Hazeltine and SOROC terminals.  They are described
below:


CUSTOMER 2     This is preconfigured to support Hazeltine and
               Craig Volker terminals which use the "ESC" (code
               1B hex) character as the lead in, instead of the
               "~" (code 7E hex).

CUSTOMER 1     This is preconfigured to support the "Insert
               Line" and "Delete Line" functions on the SOROC
               140 terminal, which are not available on the
               SOROC 120.


     Following your selection of a terminal from the menu, the
customization program asks for up to two "Escape Mode
Characters", in case you are using escape sequences from the
keyboard.  Your terminal may also send escape sequences when you
type a function key.  For example, the Heath/Zenith H19 sends
escape sequences beginning with the ESC character.  The
Televideo 920C sends escape sequences beginning with "CTRL-A".
The next question is  "Enter Common 2nd Character in Escape
Sequence".  Simply answer with a <RETURN> if you are not using
escape sequences or are typing them in by hand.  However, some
terminal's special function keys send 3 letter escape sequences
where the second letter is always the same and should be
ignored.  In this case, answer with this second character.  For
example, on the H19, the PF1 key sends an "ESC ? p", the PF2 key
sends an "ESC ? r" and so on.  In this case, the "?" is the
common second character.  Some terminals, like the IBM 3101,
also send a Carriage Return at the end of escape sequences.  The
keyboard customization detects this automatically and you need
not be concerned with it.

     While most terminals have 24 lines, some have a 25th
"Status Line".  On some of these, it is possible for VEDIT to
place its status line on the 25th line.  These terminals are
marked with a "*" following the terminal's name in the menu.  To
use the 25th line answer the question "Enter Number of Screen
Lines" with a "25".  Note that the Intertube must be specified
as having 25 lines.

     In the  VEDIT CRT version 1.33, the right-most column of
the screen is not used.  This is necessary because many CRT
terminals perform a scroll when the last column in the bottom
row is written.  If loosing this last column is a problem to
you, we can supply a simple patch which will permit VEDIT to use
the last column, but at the expense of having scrolling not
appear as "clean".  (The status line will appear to jump up and
down as the screen scrolls.)  If you are sure that your CRT does
not scroll when writing the last screen position, you may
customize VEDIT with the two screen length values one larger
than the true length.  Specifically, the H19 may be customized
with a "81" for the two screen length values.

     For your information the file  "VEDITCRT.LST" includes
several pages of source code listing of the CRT dependent
routines and tables in VEDIT.  The file "VDSETTBL.LST" includes
a listing of the tables for each CRT terminal in the menu.
These tables determine the escape sequences sent to the terminal
to perform the cursor addressing and other CRT functions.  99%
of users will never need to refer to these listings, since the
customization requires no "patches".  If you have a terminal
which is not mentioned in the menu, we will gladly modify the
tables for you.  However, we also know that some users run
custom hardware or CRT emulation software, and they may wish to
make changes to these tables themselves (we will gladly be of
assistance here too).

     While we have made every effort to support each CRT
terminal correctly, it is not feasible for anyone to test all
models of every manufacturer.  Should you notice any
aberrations, such as scrambled lines or lost characters, it is
almost certainly due to an incorrect setting on your terminal or
an error in the support for your terminal.  Please be sure that
any switches pertaining to cursor addressing, editing functions
and correct "Escape Sequence Lead In" are enabled.  Should you
have any suggestions or difficulties, no matter how minor,
please contact us.  Should you write, please include you office
and home phone numbers.
