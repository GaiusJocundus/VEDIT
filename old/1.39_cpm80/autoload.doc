
       USING THE AUTO-STARTUP FEATURE IN VEDIT 1.39/1.17

    VEDIT 1.39/1.17 supports a useful and powerful auto startup
feature which will automatically execute a startup file on disk
as a command macro.  When VEDIT is invoked,  it will search the
default  drive,  followed  by  drive  'A',  for  a  file  named
'VEDIT.INI'. If this file exists, VEDIT  will read it into text
register #0, treat  the contents  of VEDIT.INI  as command mode
instructions and execute  them before the  edit session begins.
After execution  of  the  contents  of  VEDIT.INI,  VEDIT  will
proceed with the edit session.

     It is important to remember  that the auto-startup feature
is optional. VEDIT will  not give an error  message if there is
no VEDIT.INI file  on the  disk. If  there is  a VEDIT.INI file
present on the disk, VEDIT will execute its contents EVERY TIME
an edit session begins.

     The auto-startup  file, VEDIT.INI,  may contain  any legal
command mode commands,  as  described  in  the  VEDIT 1.39/1.17
manual. Terminals such as the Ann Arbor Ambassador, VISUAL 200,
the TeleVideo 950, etc., can be extensively initialized through
the use of  VEDIT's  auto-startup  file.  This  can  be done by
creating a  VEDIT.INI file  similar to  the example  below, and
having it read into  TEXT REGISTER #1  an ASCII file containing
programming information for the CRT terminal.

     Another common  use for  the auto-startup  is to  load the
text registers with text  or command macros  which you commonly
use.   VEDIT's   operating    parameters   (word-wrap   column,
conditional convert character, etc.)  can also be  setup in the
VEDIT.INI file.


     For example, a simple  VEDIT.INI file might  be created to
program the function keys  on  a  CRT  terminal.  The Ann Arbor
AMBASSADOR terminal may be programmed from the host computer to
send custom ASCII codes for each  of its special function keys.
To program these  output codes, an  ASCII file must  be sent to
the terminal which  contains the relevant  escape sequences and
control characters. An example of a file containing information
for the programming  of  key  codes  is  present  on your VEDIT
distribution diskette  as  A2SETUP  (this  file  works  for the
AMBASSADOR terminal,  and is  intended to  serve as  an example
only).

     In order for VEDIT  to  send  this  file  to  the CRT, the
following VEDIT.INI file must be created which will be executed
by VEDIT at the start of the edit session:

RL1 A2SETUP
RD1
0P1

     When VEDIT finds the supplied VEDIT.INI file, the contents
of the file are copied into TEXT REGISTER #0. VEDIT then begins
to execute the following commands:


RL1 A2SETUP           First, VEDIT is  instructed to search the
                      diskette for a file called "A2SETUP" and,
                      if found,  copy  its  contents  into TEXT
                      REGISTER #1.

RD1                   Second, VEDIT is  instructed to  type the
                      contents  of  TEXT  REGISTER  #1  to  the
                      screen. The 'RD'  command tells  VEDIT to
                      NOT expand control characters as it types
                      them to the CRT, but to send their actual
                      values.

0P1                   Third, VEDIT is  instructed to  clear the
                      contents of TEXT REGISTER #1.
