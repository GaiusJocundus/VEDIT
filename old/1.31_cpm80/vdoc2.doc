	Visual Mode


	Properties
	----------

	     In visual mode the screen continuously displays the region of the
	file being edited and a cursor.  The left most column does not contain
	text, but rather  is  reserved  for  the  line continuation indicator.
	(The character used for the line  continuation indicator is set by the
	user during customization. A "-" is suggested.) The bottom screen line
	is used for  status  information  consisting  of  letters or messages.
	(Some CRT displays allow the letters  of messages to appear in reverse
	video.) Characters typed while in  visual mode take effect immediately
	when typed.  There  are  two  basic  kinds  of  keyboard  characters -
	Displayable characters and Control characters.  Displayable characters
	appear on the  screen  while  control  characters  immediately perform
	their operation.  The control  characters  either  move  the cursor or
	perform a visual function.

	     Each text line is  assumed  to  end  in  a  [CR] [LF]  pair as is
	required for other CP/M  programs, and the [LF]  is the true delimiter
	of the  text  lines.  Typing  the  [RETURN]  or  [CR]  key  inserts  a
	[CR] [LF] pair at the  cursor position.  Deleting  the end  of a line,
	will delete both the [CR] and  the [LF].  While VEDIT, in visual mode,
	will never create a line ending in just a [CR] or [LF], such lines are
	handled in visual  mode,  although  displayed  differently.  (They may
	result from unexacting use of the  "D" command in command mode).  If a
	line ends  in only  a [LF],  the next  line will  be displayed  with a
	starting position directly below  the end  of the  previous line (just
	like many terminals display).  If a line  contains a [CR] not followed
	by a [LF], the character  following the [CR] will  be displayed in the
	reserved column of the same screen line and the rest of the characters
	will overwrite previous  characters.  (This is not  very eloquent, but
	is just what  most terminals  would do).  Such  lines may  be fixed by
	deleting the offending lone [CR]  or [LF] with the  [DEL] key and then
	inserting the [CR] [LF] pair with the [RETURN] key.

	     The visual mode performs auto-buffering when the user reaches the
	end of the text  buffer, and  the entire  input file  has not yet been
	read.  Specifically, if the current screen  display reaches the end of
	the text buffer,  the  auto-buffering  is  performed.  VEDIT will also
	perform an auto-write if  the  text  buffer  reaches  its maximum size
	while the user is  typing in  more text.  At  this point  the first 1K
	text bytes will attempt  to  be  written  to  the  output file.  If no
	output file is open, or the cursor is  within the first 1K of the text
	buffer, no writing occurs  and the  "FULL" message  appears instead on
	the status line.  Both  the auto-buffering  and the  auto-write may be
	disabled by the "Auto Buffering in Visual Mode" switch.

	Displayable Characters
	----------------------

	When a displayable character is typed, it appears on the screen at the
	current cursor position and the cursor then moves to its right.  VEDIT
	has two modes for  inserting new  characters, NORMAL  and INSERT mode.
	When a displayable character is typed in NORMAL mode it appears at the
	cursor  position  and  any   character  which  was   there  is  simply
	overwritten.  The only exception to this  is the [CR] [LF] pair, which
	is not overwritten, but  is squeezed  to the  right.  Also, typing the
	[RETURN] does  not  overwrite  any  character,  but  rather  moves any
	character at the cursor position to the next line.  In INSERT mode, no
	character is ever  overwritten, but  rather is  squeezed to  the right
	when a new character is typed at  its position.  In either mode, a new
	screen line, called  a  continuation  line,  is  begun  on  the CRT if
	necessary.  Visual functions  exist to  go into  Insert Mode,  go into
	Normal mode, or to switch between the modes.  The editor always starts
	in Normal mode.

	     The  keyboard  characters   [RETURN]  or   [CR]  and   [TAB]  are
	displayable characters,  but  have  special  properties.  The Carriage
	Return character [RETURN] causes a [CR] and  line feed [LF] pair to be
	inserted into the text and  a new line to  be begun on the screen.  If
	it is typed while the cursor is pointing within a text line, that line
	is effectively split into two lines.  The  Tab key causes insertion of
	a tab character, or optionally, spaces  to the next tab position.  The
	tab character itself  is displayed  with spaces  on the  screen to the
	next tab position, even  though the  spaces do  not exist  in the text
	buffer.

	Control Characters
	------------------

	     The  control  characters  fall  into  two  subcategories:  Cursor
	Movement and Visual Function.  The cursor  movement keys only move the
	cursor to some other position  in the text and  do not actually change
	the text.  The visual functions [SET INSERT MODE], [RESET INSERT MODE]
	and [SWITCH INSERT  MODE] are  used for  switching between  NORMAL and
	INSERT mode.  The visual functions  for removing text  are [DEL] which
	deletes a character,  [EREOL]  for  deleting  (erasing)  all remaining
	characters on the line from the cursor position, [ERLINE] for deleting
	the entire text  line, and [BACKSPACE]  which moves the  cursor to the
	left and deletes  the character there.  The  visual function [RESTART]
	starts the edit session over, saving the current file on disk, just as
	the EA command does.  Additionally the  visual functions [COPY TO TEXT
	REGISTER], [MOVE TO TEXT REGISTER] and [INSERT TEXT REGISTER] are used
	to move or copy text  from one area in  the file to another.  The text
	register used is the  same  as  used  in  command  mode, thus the text
	register may be set  in command  mode and  inserted in  visual mode or
	vice versa.

	Visual Mode - Control Characters  (Cursor Movement)



	[HOME]           Move the cursor  to the  very first  character in the
	                 text buffer.

	[ZEND]           Move the  cursor to  the very  last character  in the
	                 text buffer.

	[CURSOR DOWN]    Move the cursor down one line, to the same horizontal
	                 position if possible.  If the  position is beyond the
	                 end of the line, move to the  end of the line, if the
	                 position is in the  middle of a tab,  move to the end
	                 of the tab.  If there is no line, don't move.

	[CURSOR UP]      Move the cursor  up one line,  to the same horizontal
	                 position if possible.  The same  rules as for [CURSOR
	                 DOWN] apply.

	[CURSOR LEFT]    Move the  cursor  to  the  previous  character in the
	                 text.  If currently at beginning of line, move to end
	                 of previous line.  If there is no line, don't move.

	[CURSOR RIGHT]   Move the cursor  to the  next character  in the text.
	                 If currently  at end  of line,  move to  beginning of
	                 next line.  If there is no line, don't move.

	[PAGE DOWN]      This scrolls the  screen to give  a similar effect to
	                 typing [CURSOR DOWN] for 3/4 screen lines.

	[PAGE UP]        This scrolls the  screen to give  a similar effect to
	                 typing [CURSOR UP] for 3/4 screen lines.

	[BACK TAB]       This moves the  cursor to  the first  position in the
	                 current physical line.  If  the cursor  is already at
	                 the first  position, the  cursor is  moved up  to the
	                 first position of the previous screen line.

	[TAB CURSOR]     This moves the cursor to the next tab stop.

	[ZIP]            This moves the cursor to the end of the text line the
	                 cursor is on.  If  it already  is at  the end  of the
	                 line, it moves to the end of the next text line.

	[NEXTLINE]       This moves the  cursor to  the beginning  of the next
	                 text line.

	Visual Mode - Control Characters  (Visual Function)


	[SET INSERT MODE] Change the mode to INSERT if not already there.

	[RESET INS MODE]  Change the mode to NORMAL if not already there.

	[SWITCH INS MODE] Switch the mode to the opposite.  Note that normally
	                  either [SET  INS  MODE]  and  [RESET  INS  MODE]  or
	                  [SWITCH INS  MODE] would  be implemented  during the
	                  VEDIT Customization process.

	[DELETE]          Delete the character  at  the  cursor position.  The
	                  cursor doesn't move.  A lone [CR]  or [LF] will also
	                  be deleted,  but  a  [CR] [LF]  pair  will  both  be
	                  deleted as one.

	[BACKSPACE]       Move the cursor  left  and  delete  the character at
	                  that position.  Does not delete a [CR] [LF].

	[EREOL]           This deletes all characters from the cursor position
	                  to the end  of  the  text  line  but  not  the final
	                  [CR][LF] pair unless the text  line only consists of
	                  the [CR][LF], in which case the [CR][LF] is deleted.
	                  For example,  to  completely  delete  a  line  would
	                  require the following sequence:

	                   [BACK TAB] [EREOL] [EREOL].

	[ERLINE]          This deletes the entire text line. Use of [BACK TAB]
	                  [EREOL] is  actually  preferable,  since  the latter
	                  does not close  up  the  screen  line and frequently
	                  allows the [UNDO] to restore the original line.

	[UNDO]            This rewrites the  screen  and  ignores  the changes
	                  made to the text line the cursor is on.

	[RESTART]         The text buffer  and any  unappended portion  of the
	                  input file  is  written  to  the  output  file.  The
	                  output file is closed and then reopened as the Input
	                  and Output file.  The  file  is  then  read into the
	                  text buffer again.

	Visual Mode - Control Characters  (Visual Function)


	[COPY TO TEXT REG] The first time this key is hit, the position of the
	                   cursor is remembered,  and an  "E" is  displayed on
	                   the status line.  When the key  is hit while an "E"
	                   is displayed,  the  text  block  between  the first
	                   cursor position and the  current cursor position is
	                   copied to  the  text  register.  Assuming  there is
	                   enough memory space for this  "copy", a "T" is then
	                   displayed on the status  line in place  of the "E".
	                   If insufficient memory  space  exists,  no  copy is
	                   made, the "E"  is  erased  and  the  "FULL" message
	                   appears on the status line.  Hitting this key twice
	                   at the same  cursor  position  will  empty the text
	                   register.  Note that either  the  beginning  or the
	                   end of the text block may be set first.

	[MOVE TO TEXT REG] This is similar  to [COPY TO TEXT REG], except that
	                   the text block  is  deleted  from  the  text buffer
	                   after it is moved to the text register.

	[INSERT TEXT REG]  A copy of the current text  register is inserted at
	                   the   current   cursor   position.  If   there   is
	                   insufficient memory space  for  the  entire "copy",
	                   nothing is inserted  and  the  "FULL"  message will
	                   appear on  the status  line.  Moving the  cursor to
	                   another line will clear the "FULL" message.

	[VISUAL EXIT]      Visual Mode is exited to command mode.  The current
	                   cursor position in the text  buffer will become the
	                   command  mode  edit   pointer  position.  Any  text
	                   register is preserved.

	[VISUAL ESCAPE]    This is identical to the [VISUAL EXIT], except that
	                   any current iteration macro is aborted.
