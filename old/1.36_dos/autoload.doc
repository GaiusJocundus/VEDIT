
	USING THE AUTO-STARTUP FEATURE IN VEDIT 1.36/1.14


	VEDIT 1.36/1.14 supports a powerful auto startup feature which
will automatically execute a startup file on disk as a command macro.
When VEDIT is invoked to edit a file on disk, VEDIT will first search
the disk for a file called 'VEDIT.INI'. If this file exists, VEDIT will
then treat the contents of VEDIT.INI as command mode instructions and
execute them before the edit session begins. After execution of the
contents of VEDIT.INI, VEDIT will proceed with the edit session. If
there is no 'VEDIT.INI' on the disk, VEDIT will start the edit session
on the desired file.

	It is important to remember that the auto-startup feature is
optional. VEDIT will not give an error message if there is no VEDIT.INI
file on the disk. If there is a VEDIT.INI file present on the disk,
VEDIT will execute its contents EVERY TIME an edit session with VEDIT
begins.

	For example, a simple VEDIT.INI file might be created which
would serve to initialize a CRT terminal. The ANN ARBOR AMBASSADOR
terminal may be programmed from the host computer to output custom ASCII
codes for each of its special function keys. To program these output
codes, an ASCII file must be sent to the terminal which contains the
relevant escape sequences and control characters. An example of a file
containing information for the programming of key codes is present on
your VEDIT distribution diskette as A2SETUP (this file works for the
AMBASSADOR terminal, and is intended to serve as an example only).

	In order for VEDIT to send this file to the CRT, the following
VEDIT.INI file must be created which will be executed by VEDIT at the
start of the edit session:

RL1 A2SETUP$
RD1$
0P1$

	...where "$" indicates an ESCAPE
	character that has been inserted at the
	end of each command line by using the
	visual function, 'NEXT CHAR LITERAL'.

	When VEDIT finds the supplied VEDIT.INI file, the contents of
the file are copied into TEXT REGISTER #0. VEDIT then begins to execute
the following commands:

	RL1 A2SETUP$		First, VEDIT is instructed to search
				the diskette for a file called
				"A2SETUP" and, if found, copy its
				contents into TEXT REGISTER #1.

	RD1$			Second, VEDIT is instructed to type
				the contents of TEXT REGISTER #1
				to the screen. The 'RD' command tells
				VEDIT to NOT expand control characters
				as it types them to the CRT, but to send
				their actual values.

	0P1			Third, VEDIT is instructed to clear
				the contents of TEXT REGISTER #1.

After the auto-startup file has executed, VEDIT will begin the edit
session on the text file specified during VEDIT invocation (if any).  The
auto-startup file, VEDIT.INI, may contain any legal command mode
commands, as described in the VEDIT 1.36/1.14 manual. Terminals such as
the VISUAL 200, the TeleVideo 950, etc., may require extensive
initialization from the host computer, and VEDIT's auto-startup feature
is an excellent means of accomplishing this at the start of an edit
session. All the user need do is to create a VEDIT.INI file similar to
the example provided, but have it load up into TEXT REGISTER #1 an ascii
file containing programming information for the crt.

	Another common use for the auto-startup is to load the text
registers with text or command macros which you commonly use.

	This new feature of VEDIT 1.36/1.14 is best understood by
experimenting with simple variants of the supplied VEDIT.INI example.
Remember that you may also change VEDIT's operating parameters (word-wrap
column, conditional convert character, etc.) in the VEDIT.INI file.
