     The menu of CRT terminals displayed in the customization
program contains two undefined entries: "Customer 2" and
"Customer 1". These are actually preconfigured as alternatives
for some Hazeltine and SOROC terminals.  They are described
below:


CUSTOMER 2     This is preconfigured to support Hazeltine and
               Craig Volker terminals which use the "ESC" (code
               1B hex) character as the lead in, instead of the
               "~" (code 7E hex).

CUSTOMER 1     This is preconfigured to support the "Insert
               Line" and "Delete Line" functions on the SOROC
               140 terminal, which are not available on the
               SOROC 120.


     On Hazeltine terminals you must set the "Auto LF" option
switch to the OFF position.  This will not affect the terminals
operation with CP/M based systems, but is necessary for VEDIT to
work properly.


     Following your selection of a terminal from the menu, the
customization program asks for up to two "Escape Mode
Characters", in case you are using escape sequences from the
keyboard.  Your terminal may also send escape sequences when you
type a function key.  For example, the Heath/Zenith H19 sends
escape sequences beginning with the ESC character. The Televideo
920C sends escape sequences beginning with "CTRL-A".

     The next two questions are "Enter Common 2nd Character #1
in Escape Sequence" and "Enter Common 2nd Character #2 in Escape
Sequence". Simply answer with a <RETURN> if you are not using
escape sequences or are typing them in by hand.  However, some
terminal's special function keys send 3 letter escape sequences
where the second letter is always the same and should be
ignored.  In this case, answer with this second character.

     For example, on the H19 using Heath Mode, the PF1 key sends
an "ESC ? p", the PF2 key sends an "ESC ? r" and so on.  In this
case, the "?" is the "Common 2nd Character #1...".  Answer
RETURN to "Common 2nd Character #2...".

     On the VT-100, VT-180 and other ANSI standard terminals,
the function keys send sequences such as "ESC O A", "ESC O B",
"ESC [ H", "ESC [ I", etc, where both the "O" and "[" are common
2nd characters which are to be ignored.  Therefore "Common 2nd
Character #1..." should be answered with a "O" (capital letter
O), and "Common 2nd Character #2..." should be answered with a
"[".

     Some terminals, like the IBM 3101,  also send a Carriage
Return at the end of escape sequences.  The keyboard
customization detects this automatically and you need not be
concerned with it.

     While most terminals have 24 lines, some have a 25th
"Status Line".  On some of these, it is possible for VEDIT to
place its status line on the 25th line.  These terminals are
marked with a "*" following the terminal's name in the menu.  To
use the 25th line answer the question "Enter Number of Screen
Lines" with a "25".  Note that the Intertube must be specified
as having 25 lines.

     In the  VEDIT CRT version 1.36, the right-most column of
the screen is not used.  This is necessary because many CRT
terminals perform a scroll when the last column in the bottom
row is written.  If loosing this last column is a problem to
you, we can supply a patch which will permit VEDIT to use the
last column, but at the expense of having scrolling not appear
as "clean".  (The status line will appear to jump up and down as
the screen scrolls.)  If you are sure that your CRT does not
scroll when writing the last screen position, you may customize
VEDIT with the screen length value one larger than the true
length.  Specifically, the H19 may be customized with a "81" for
the screen length parameter (customization Task 5.6).


     For your information the file  "VEDITZC.LST" includes
several pages of source code listing of the CRT dependent
routines and tables in VEDIT. The file "CRT.ASM" is the source
code for the file "CRT.TBL" which contains the control codes for
each of the CRT terminals displayed in the menu. These control
codes and escape sequences perform the cursor addressing and
other CRT functions.  99% of users will never need to refer to
these listings, since the customization requires no "patches".
If you have a terminal which is not mentioned in the menu, we
will gladly modify the tables for you.  However, we also know
that some users run custom hardware or CRT emulation software,
and they may wish to make changes to these tables themselves (we
will gladly be of assistance here too).


     While we have made every effort to support each CRT
terminal correctly, it is not feasible for anyone to test all
models of every manufacturer. Should you notice any aberrations,
such as scrambled lines or lost characters, it is almost
certainly due to an incorrect setting on your terminal or an
error in the support for your terminal.  Please be sure that any
switches pertaining to cursor addressing, editing functions and
correct "Escape Sequence Lead In" are enabled.  Should you have
any suggestions or difficulties, no matter how minor, please
contact us. Should you write, please include you office and home
phone numbers.
